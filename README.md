<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About BDOSC

![Exemple picture of BDOSC](https://i.imgur.com/bPQFrrb.png)

<h3 align="center">BDOSC is a Windows desktop app that helps you keep an eye on your bartering stocks and track the carrack(s) you're working towards. It was developed with the KISS principle in mind, which is dear to us, while wishing for a decent enough and ergonomic GUI.</h3>

<br />
<br />

### The App:

* The app has two main tabs, one for Bartering stocks and the other for Carrack tracking.

* The visual theme is intentionally inspired by the default UI of BDO.

* You can change the language to English or French at any time by clicking on the little flag on the top right (only languages supported as of right now).

* It is possible to reset all saved data in the app with the Reset button, indicated by a bin on the bottom right, you'll be warned, a lot, like a lot.

* The app will update itself automatically if any new release is distributed on this Github.

* The app files are located in C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Local\bdo-sea-companion and C:\Users\XXX\AppData\Roaming\BDO Sea Companion.

* You can uninstall the app like any other app with the "Programs and Features" menu of Windows.

<br />

### The Bartering:

* The Bartering tab lets you keep an eye on the most frequently used storages for Bartering: Iliya, Epheria, and Ancado.

* It also lets you quickly edit your bartering stocks without using your mouse, making mass editing more efficient.

* You can use the Search function when planning a certain route, e.g. "Marble+Round knife+Lava", to see and edit only those three items.

* You can hide any tiers of bartering items you wish, to make it easier to read your stocks, or toggle the different storages on and off.

* You can set a threshold warning to alert you if an item falls below a certain threshold. (You can choose to disable certain tiers for certain storages.)

* There is also a "Special Barter Estimate" feature that calculates an estimate based on the last time you had a special barter appear and your total number of barters.

* The Total Value feature displays the total value in silver of all your accumulated bartering items.

<br />

### The Carrack:

* First, you will be prompted to choose which carrack you are working towards.

* Next, you will see your Inventory, which lists the items needed for the chosen carrack. Simply enter whatever you already have in this section.

* You can keep track of how much of each item you need with the Total Needed feature on the right. You can also choose to hide any finished items from the list by checking the box on top of said list.

* The Tracker section shows you every parts for the carrack you have chosen and what is specifically needed for each part.

* The app checks your Inventory and gives priority to the parts based on a top-to-bottom order.

* You can drag the different parts to change the priority in which the app distributes items from your Inventory.

* When you get a new item, you can either change the amount in your Inventory or click on any items from any part in the Tracker section to directly get to that item in your Inventory.

* You can change your carrack choice at any point without losing your Inventory.
