# CHANGELOG - v0.1.3 Beta | 17/03/2023

**Additions**
- Added an progress bar (and percentage) to the total needed in the "Carrack" tab.
- Added some log file, that you can find in the \"Logs\" folder. It will help me to find the problem if you have any.

**Removal**

**Fixes**
- If you un-check one of the storage, the program will now save it and won't check it again when you relaunch the program.
- Fixed a bug with the environement variable of the github Token - Now the auto-update should work properly.

**Notes**
- The program will - NORMALY - automatically update itself when you launch it. But I can't guarantee that it will work properly. If you have any problem, please look in the GitHub for a new version.
- The verification of all the data files is in test, so if you find any problem, please report it on GitHub.
- This software is still in development, so if you find any problem, please report it on GitHub. Thank you!
