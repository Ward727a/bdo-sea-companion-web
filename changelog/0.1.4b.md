# CHANGELOG - v0.1.4 Beta | 19/03/2023

**Additions**


**Removal**

**Fixes**
- Fixed some bugs with the "+10" items in the "Carrack" tab. Now the item should be green if you have enough, and they will be taken in account in the progress bar.
- The "Fix" line (where you are now) had an error in the title. It's now fixed.


**Notes**
- The program will - NORMALY - automatically update itself when you launch it. But I can't guarantee that it will work properly. If you have any problem, please look in the GitHub for a new version.
- The verification of all the data files is in test, so if you find any problem, please report it on GitHub.
- This software is still in development, so if you find any problem, please report it on GitHub. Thank you!
