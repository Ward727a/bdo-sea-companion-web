# CHANGELOG - v0.1.1 Beta | 11/03/2023

**Additions**
- Now you can see the "disclaimer" in English & French.
- Added a button to reset ALL the data (like a 'factory reset'), with some confirmation.
- Added an icon next to the changelog title to access to a page with all the changelog.

**Fixes**
- Fixed the margin of the "total value".

**Notes**
- The program will - NORMALY - automatically update itself when you launch it. But I can't guarantee that it will work properly. If you have any problem, please look in the GitHub for a new version.
- The verification of all the data files is in test, so if you find any problem, please report it on GitHub.
- This software is still in development, so if you find any problem, please report it on GitHub. Thank you!
